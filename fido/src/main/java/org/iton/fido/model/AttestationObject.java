/**
 * Authenticators MUST provide some form of attestation. The basic requirement is that the authenticator can produce,
 * for each credential public key, an attestation statement verifiable by the WebAuthn Relying Party. Typically, this
 * attestation statement contains a signature by an attestation private key over the attested credential public key and
 * a challenge, as well as a certificate or similar data providing provenance information for the attestation public
 * key, enabling the Relying Party to make a trust decision. However, if an attestation key pair is not available, then
 * the authenticator MUST perform <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn/#self-attestation">self
 * attestation</a> of the credential public key with the corresponding credential private key. All this information is
 * returned by authenticators any time a new public key credential is generated, in the overall form of an attestation
 * object. The relationship of the attestation object with authenticator data (containing attested credential data) and
 * the attestation statement is illustrated in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn//#fig-attStructs">figure 5</a>.
